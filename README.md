# Quiz: JavaScript - Overview

This is my base level attempt of a quiz app/website. It works locally and uses the questions in the JavaScript code.

This project was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It requires [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/) to be installed.

    git clone https://github.com/tanmichael1/Quiz-Javascript.git
    cd quiz
    npm install

## Usage

    npm start
